```

Exercise:
Replace "Hello World" with your name or a short greeting of your choice.
```{r}

```

Objects in R
Numerical Data
Numerical values are the most basic data type in R.

```{r}
1
typeof(1)
```

Perform arithmetic operations:
```{r}
1 / 2
1.5
typeof(1/2)
typeof(1.5)
```
Note: Integers are a subset of doubles, but without decimals. Convert a double to an integer:

```{r}
as.integer(3.14)
```


Exercise:
Create and manipulate numerical data, then check its type.
```{r}

```

Character Data (Strings)
Strings represent text, enclosed in double " or single ' quotes.


```{r}
"Hello"
typeof("Hello")
```

Even numbers in quotes are treated as characters:
```{r}
"2"
typeof("2")
```

Exercise:
Write your favorite quote as a string and check its type.
```{r}

```

Factors
Factors are categorical variables with predefined levels.

```{r}
factor(c("red", "blue", "green"))
```

Concatenate using c():
```{r}
c(1, 4, 7)
c("data", "science", "R")
```

```{r}
c(1, 2, "analysis")
typeof(c(1, 2, "analysis"))
```


Create a factor with days of the week.
Mix numbers and characters in a concatenation.
```{r}

```



Variables in R
Variables store data and can be assigned using <-, ->, or =.
```{r}
x <- 5
x

5 -> y
y

b = "Hello"
b
```

Rules for Variable Names
Must start with a letter.
Can contain letters, numbers, dots, or underscores.
Cannot contain spaces or start with a number.

```{r}
valid_variable <- 10
anotherValid.variable <- 20
```

Exercise:
Create variables with valid names storing your age, favorite number, or text.
Try creating a variable with an invalid name and observe the error.
```{r}

```


Structured and Unstructured Data
Structured Data
Structured data is organized into rows and columns, like in a table or dataframe.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Score = c(90, 85, 88)
)
df
```
Access elements:
```{r}
df$Name      # Access the 'Name' column
df[1, ]      # Access the first row
df[1, "Age"] # Access the 'Age' value of the first row
```

Exercise:
Create a dataframe with your own data (e.g., Name, Hobby, Favorite Number).
Access specific rows or columns.
```{r}

```

Unstructured Data
Unstructured data lacks a predefined format, like text, images, or raw sensor data.
```{r}
text <- "R is great for data analysis and visualization!"
nchar(text)  # Count characters
strsplit(text, " ")  # Split into words
```

Exercise:
Write a sentence as unstructured data. Count the words in it.
Split the text into individual words and analyze their length with len() function.
```{r}

```

Comparing Structured and Unstructured Data
```{r}
structured <- data.frame(
  Category = c("A", "B", "C"),
  Value = c(10, 20, 30)
)
structured

unstructured <- "Category A has 10 units, B has 20, and C has 30."
unstructured
```



Data frames
Working with Different Types of Variables in a Dataframe
A dataframe in R is a structured collection of data where each column can store a different type of variable (numerical, character, factor, etc.).

Creating a Dataframe with Multiple Variable Types
You can combine variables of different types into a dataframe:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),  # Character (categorical)
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),                 # Numeric
  Score = c(90.5, 85.3, 88.9),         # Double
  Passed = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)        # Logical
)
df
```


Checking Variable Types
To check the types of variables in a dataframe, use the str() or sapply() functions:
```{r}
str(df)          # Overview of dataframe structure
sapply(df, typeof) # Check each column's type
```



Accessing Columns
You can access specific columns by their names or indices:
```{r}
df$Name     # Access 'Name' column
df[["Age"]] # Another way to access 'Age' column
df[, 3]     # Access the 3rd column
```



Exercise:
Access the Score column and calculate the average.
Access the Passed column and count how many TRUE values are present.
```{r}

```



Mixing Types of Variables
Numerical Variables
Columns with numbers can store integer or double values. Operations can be applied directly:

```{r}
mean(df$Age)      # Calculate the mean of 'Age'
sum(df$Score)     # Sum of 'Score'
df$Age + 5        # Add 5 to all ages


df
```


Character Variables
Character columns store text and are treated as categorical by default in R dataframes:
```{r}
toupper(df$Name)  # Convert names to uppercase
nchar(df$Name)    # Count the number of characters in each name
```


Factor Variables
Convert character variables to factors to work with specific categories:
```{r}
df$Name <- as.factor(df$Name)
levels(df$Name)  # Check levels of the factor
```

Logical Variables
Logical columns store TRUE/FALSE values, useful for filtering:
```{r}
df$Passed[df$Passed == TRUE]   # Filter rows where 'Passed' is TRUE
```


Adding and Modifying Variables in a Dataframe
Adding a New Column
You can add new variables to the dataframe, derived from existing ones:
```{r}

df$Grade <- ifelse(df$Score > 88, "A", "B")  # Add a grade column
df
```

Changing Variable Types
If needed, change the type of a column:

```{r}
df$Age <- as.character(df$Age)  # Convert 'Age' to character
typeof(df$Age)
```


Dealing with Mixed Variable Types
Converting Columns
R automatically tries to unify types in mixed columns, often converting numbers to characters:

```{r}
mixed <- c(1, "two", 3)
typeof(mixed)  # Will be character
```


Handling NA (Missing Values)
Missing values (NA) can appear in any variable type. Handle them using functions like is.na():
```{r}
df$Age[2] <- NA     # Introduce an NA value
mean(df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate mean ignoring NA
```


Exercises
Create a Dataframe:
```{r}

```

Create a dataframe with at least three columns:
One numeric (e.g., age).
One character (e.g., name).
One logical (e.g., likes ice cream).
```{r}

```



Modify the Dataframe:
Add a new column that calculates the age in months.
Convert one column to a different type (e.g., Name to a factor).
```{r}

```


Filter Rows:
Filter the dataframe to show only rows where LikesIceCream is TRUE.
Summarize Variables:
```{r}

```


DPplyr/tidyverse

The dplyr package from the tidyverse ecosystem is a powerful tool for working with dataframes in R. Let's learn some basic operations.

Loading the dplyr Package
Before you begin, make sure to load the package
If you donâ€™t have it installed, you can install it first
```{r}
library(dplyr)
#install.packages("dplyr")
```

Basic Operations
1. Selecting Columns
Use the select() function to choose specific columns from a dataframe.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Score = c(90.5, 85.3, 88.9),
  Passed = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

# Select specific columns
select(df, Name, Age)
# Exclude specific columns
select(df, -Passed)
```


Exercise:
Select only the Score and Passed columns from the dataframe.
```{r}

```

2. Filtering Rows
Use filter() to select rows based on conditions.

```{r}
filter(df, Age > 30)
filter(df, Passed == TRUE)
```

Exercise:
Filter rows where Score is greater than 88.
```{r}

```


3. Adding New Columns
Use mutate() to add or modify columns.
```{r}
mutate(df, Grade = ifelse(Score > 88, "A", "B"))

mutate(df, AgeMonths = Age * 12)
```


Create a new column that calculates the square root of the Score.
```{r}

```

4. Summarizing Data
Use summarize() to calculate summary statistics.

```{r}
summarize(df, AverageScore = mean(Score))
summarize(df, AverageScore = mean(Score), TotalPassed = sum(Passed))
```

To summarize groups of data, combine summarize() with group_by():
```{r}

df %>%
  group_by(Passed) %>%
  summarize(
    AverageScore = mean(Score),
    Count = n()
  )
```


Exercise:
Group by Grade and calculate the total number of people in each grade category.
```{r}

```

5. Rearranging Rows
Use arrange() to sort rows.
```{r}
arrange(df, Score)
```

# Sort rows by Score in descending order
```{r}
arrange(df, desc(Score))
```


Exercise:
Sort the dataframe by Age in ascending order.
```{r}

```

Combining Operations with the Pipe (%>%)
The pipe operator %>% makes your code more readable by chaining operations together.
```{r}
df %>%
  select(Name, Score) %>%
  filter(Score > 88) %>%
  arrange(desc(Score))

```
Exercise:
Select the Name and Age columns.
Filter rows where Age is greater than 28.
Add a column for age in months.
Arrange the result by Age in descending order.
```{r}

```



**select()**	Choose specific columns.
**filter()**	Filter rows based on conditions.
**mutate()**	Add or modify columns.
**summarize()**	Summarize data (e.g., mean, sum).
**group_by()**	Group data for grouped summaries.
**arrange()**	Sort rows in ascending/descending order.

If and loops
Conditional Statements: if and ifelse
1. if Statement
The if statement is used to execute code only if a condition is TRUE.
```{r}
x <- 5
# Check if x is greater than 3
if (x > 3) {
  print("x is greater than 3")
}
```

You can include an else block to handle the case when the condition is FALSE:
```{r}
x <- 2

if (x > 3) {
  print("x is greater than 3")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 3")
}
```

Exercise:
Write an if statement to check if a number y is positive, negative, or zero, and print an appropriate message.
```{r}

```

2. ifelse() Function
The ifelse() function is a vectorized version of if and is great for conditional logic in vectors.

```{r}
x <- c(1, -2, 3, -4, 5)
# Check if elements are positive or negative
ifelse(x > 0, "Positive", "Negative")
```


You can also assign the result to a variable:
```{r}
status <- ifelse(x > 0, "Positive", "Negative")
status
```

Exercise:
Create a vector z <- c(10, 0, -10, 5, -5) and use ifelse() to label each number as "Positive", "Zero", or "Negative".
```{r}

```

Loops: for and while
3. for Loops
A for loop iterates over a sequence.
```{r}
# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

```
# Loop through a vector
```{r}
fruits <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
for (fruit in fruits) {
  print(fruit)
}
```

Exercise:
Write a for loop to print the square of each number in the vector c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
```{r}

```

4. while Loops
A while loop continues as long as a condition is TRUE.
```{r}
# Print numbers from 1 to 5
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

Exercise:
Write a while loop to print all even numbers from 10 down to 2.
```{r}

```
